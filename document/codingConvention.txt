We use the following conventions throughout the code

1. image path for a scenery spot "A":  /data/spots/images/A/ (format of pictures fixed ".png")
    There's API query the number files in the folder, for example 6 (must be even, since there are small pics and large pics)
    small pics: 1.png,  2.png, 3.png
    large pics: 1_big.png, 2_big.png, 3_big.png

    This applies to all images for all scenery spot.

2. content path for a scenery spot "A": /data/spots/content/A/
    There should be only one file in the folder:  content.txt

3. static url for a scenery spot "A"  /data/staticUrl/spots/A.html
